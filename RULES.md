Cards Against Cryptography -- The Appendices
==========================

This is an extension for [Cards Against Cryptography](https://github.com/CardsAgainstCryptography/CAC/).

Basic Rules
-----------

Each player draws 7 white cards.

The person who most recently had a paper rejected begins as the Session Chair and picks a black card.  The Session Chair reads the black card aloud and shows it to everyone.

Every other player picks 1 white card they think completes the black card best, and submits their white card face down to the Session Chair.

The Session Chair executes a mixnet protocol, and reads aloud each card combination (black + white).  The Session Chair picks the combination they think is funniest; whoever submitted it wins the black card.

After the round, the next player becomes Session Chair.  Everyone draws back up to 7 white cards.

At any time, a player may trade in 1 of their black cards to discard as many white cards as they would like and draw back up to 7.  A player with no black cards can trade up to 3 white cards at most once per game.

The first player to win 5 black cards is declared the winner and awarded tenure.

Additional house rule variants can be found in the original instructions of Cards Against Humanity: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cah/CAH_Rules.pdf

## Appendix A


#### PICK n


Some cards say PICK _n_ on the bottom. 
To answer these, each player draws _n_ additional white cards from the white pile, and plays a combination of _n+1_ cards. 
Cards should be played in the order the Session Chair should read them --order matters. 

In the case of mutually distrustful players, card-based cryptography techniques can be used to combat malicious behaviors. 


### Academic Regulations

#### Virtual Random Fellow¹

Every round, pick the appropriate number of white cards from the pile and place them into play. 
These cards belong to the VRF --a simulated player-- and if they win the game, every player must admit that their submission did not improve the state of the art. 

		
#### Cryptographic Haikus

 Don't need to follow the 5-7-5 form. They just have to be read dramatically.
		
#### Reboot

At any time, payers may trade in one won black card to return as many white cards as they'd like to the deck and draw back up to 7.

¹This variant assumes semi-honest players.

 ## Appendix B


### Blockchain cards



#### Forks 

In case more than one blockchain card is played, players are requested to recognized their played cards.


#### DAG Chain 

In case more than one blockchain card is played, all players who played blockchain cards get a victory card. 



### Alternative Mining Rules



#### Gambling

In case of ties, you can bet one of your black cards (from your victory pile) to play an additional white card. 
If you win, you get your point back; otherwise your point goes to the winner.	

#### Byzantine Agreement

In the absence of a trusted Session Chair the consensus protocol applies. 
Each player picks their favorite card each round. The card with the most votes wins the round.
